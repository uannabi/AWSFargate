# AWSFargate
## Getting Started with AWS Fargate
Welcome to the AWS Fargate Getting Started Guide! This repository is designed to help you understand and use AWS Fargate, a serverless compute engine for containers that works with Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) and Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS).
## About AWS Fargate
AWS Fargate enables you to run containers without managing servers or clusters. It removes the need to provision, configure, and scale clusters of virtual machines to run containers, making it simpler to deploy and manage containerized applications.
## Project Objective
This project aims to guide you through the process of setting up, deploying, and managing containerized applications using AWS Fargate.
## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- An AWS account.
- Basic understanding of containerization and Docker.
- AWS CLI installed and configured.
### Installation and Setup
1. **Setting Up Your AWS Environment**
  
  Ensure your AWS account is set up and you have necessary permissions to access ECS and Fargate services.
2. **Configure AWS CLI**
  Make sure the AWS CLI is configured with appropriate credentials and default region.
  ```
  aws configure
  ```
### Deployment Guide
1. **Create a Task Definition**
  This involves defining your application within a task definition in Amazon ECS.
2. **Launch and Configure Fargate Service**
  Deploy your application by launching a Fargate service with the created task definition.
3. **Monitor Your Application**
  Utilize AWS management tools to monitor the status and performance of your application.
